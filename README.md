# This is the sample code which will explain about how to make the gRPC call reactive.
# It will also help you how to intergrate SpringWebflux with gRPC reactive.

# After clone and checkout the code is not in compileable stage as I had not checked in the code generated by protobuf.
# So after the checkout please execute 
	mvn clean install 
# This will generate the protobuf code and you are ready to start coding or exploring.

# If you want to use postman for sending the request then I had created the order.json in the resource folder you can use the same.

# For gRPC server download the code from https://github.com/MilindAtGithub/gettingstarted_grpc follow the instructions for building and run the gRPC server.

## Happy Coding :)
